Using an international database on adolescent achievement in science, mathematics, and reading (N = 472,242), we showed that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in two of every three countries, and in nearly all countries, more girls appeared capable of college-level STEM study than had enrolled. Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality.\r\n\r\n> Our analysis suggests that the percentage of girls who would likely be successful and enjoy further STEM study was considerably  higher  than  the  percentage  of  women  graduating in STEM fields, implying that there is a loss of female STEM capacity between secondary and tertiary education.\r\n\r\n> Thus, even when girls\u2019 absolute science scores were higher than those of boys, as in Finland, boys were often better in science relative to their overall  academic  average. \r\n\r\n> We also found that boys often expressed higher self-efficacy, more joy in science, and a broader interest in science  than  did  girls.

Teams do not measure the impact of their work. Or, if measurement happens, it is done in isolation by the product management team and selectively shared. You have no idea if your work worked.\r\n2. **Rapid shuffling of teams** and projects (aka Team Tetris). Instead of compelling missions or initiatives, teams deal in feature and project assignments. Chronic multitasking and over-utilization.\r\n3. **Success theater** around \u201cshipping\u201d with little discussion about impact. You can tell a great deal about an organization by what it celebrates.\r\n4. **Infrequent (acknowledged) failures** and scrapped work. No removed features. Primary measure of success is delivered features, not delivered outcomes. Work is rarely discarded in light of data and learning. Often the team lacks the prerequisite safety to admit misfires.\r\n5. **No connection to core metrics**. Infrequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team cannot connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Impossible to connect iterations to \u201cwhat matters most\u201d.\r\n6. **No PM retrospectives**. Product managers do not conduct regular retrospectives on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits. Developers have \u201cpassing tests\u201d, but product managers do not. Product managers view velocity and output as their key performance indicator.\r\n7. **Obsessing about prioritization**. Mismatch between prioritization rigor (deciding what gets worked on) and validation rigor (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on). Prioritization rigor is designed exclusively to temper internal agendas so that people \u201cfeel confident\u201d. Lots of work goes into determining which ideas to work on, leaving little leeway for adjustments and improvisation based on data. Roadmaps show a list of features, not areas of focus and/or outcomes.\r\n8. **No tweaking**. Once work is \u201cdone\u201d, the team moves immediately on to the next \u201cproject\u201d, leaving no time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data\r\n9. **Culture of hand-offs**. Front-loaded process in place to \u201cget ahead of the work\u201d so that items are \u201cready for engineering\u201d. Team is not directly involved in research, problem exploration, or experimentation and validation. Once work is shipped, team has little contact with support, customer success, and sales.\r\n10. **Large batches**. Without the mandate to experiment, features are delivered in single large batches instead of delivering incrementally. You might still work in sprints (yay, we\u2019re \u201cAgile\u201d), but nothing new is reaching customers at the conclusion of each sprint.\r\n11. **Chasing upfront revenue**. Features are implemented to close new deals. While not inherently wrong, the economic justifications are often flimsy (at best), and fail to account for the non-linear increase in product complexity (you make the quarter, but you pay for it many times over later). Again, this reinforces the idea that features are the unit of value measurement. Product decisions lack a sound economic grounding.\r\n12. **Shiny objects**. Low visibility for refactoring work and debt work-down. Low visibility for overall value delivery capabilities. As mentioned, primary measure of success is new feature output. Little appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects. Little awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* *todo* make own notes", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 145, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "list: React State Management", "content": "`started`\r\n\r\n<https://medium.com/@veeralpatel/things-ive-learned-about-state-management-for-react-apps-174b8bde87fb>\r\n\r\n> 6 things I wish I knew about state management when I started writing React apps\r\n\r\n### 1.

Stop treating it like one. It's a physical thing that happens to your body. It's your body saying \"something is wrong, fix it.\" Symptoms of stress/anxiety include things that can be measured by doctors, such as weight gain, lack of sleep, blood pressure issues, acne, hair loss, etc. Many people try to treat stress as a feeling, and do things to make them feel better, like yoga, workout, have sex, go to the gun range, or buy little stress balls that they squeeze when they feel stressed. This is the incorrect way to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nThink of stress as financial stress. What is financial stress? You have too much to pay for and not enough money. If you were financially stressed and I told you I could make you feel better about it by selling you a squeeze ball for 20 bucks, would you fall for that garbage? I hope not.\r\n\r\nThis is how stress stacks up on your life: Imagine a graph. There is an invisible line somewhere on it going straight, horizontally, all the way across. That is your personal \"stress threshold\". Literally everything that you have to do in your life is a stressor. Imagine them as blocks stacking up on top of each other. Some are bigger than others. The closer you get to your threshold, the more stressed you feel. If you do not prevent them from crossing that threshold, you will enter depression, which is your body saying \"screw it, you won't fix it, I'll just shut everything down until it works itself out.\", much like how if you're freezing to death in the woods your body starts shutting down to save the vital organs, but you will still eventually freeze to death anyways. Think of stress as you shivering when it's cold, and depression as your body shutting down to preserve vital organs.\r\n\r\nSo, this is THE way to manage stress: You manage it. The pilot giving the training said to make a list, either mentally or literally, of EVERYTHING that stresses you out. Next, look at the list and see what you can actually take care of right then and there, and start knocking things off the list. You will literally be removing stress from your life. You ever wonder why people say they feel like their \"load is lighter\" or \"weight has been lifted off their shoulders\" after they complete a task? Because it has. Ever wonder why people say they feel good after mowing the lawn, or going to the gym, or whatever? It's because they've actually removed a stress block from their life. They've done something. Often times, people try to manage stress by drinking tea, or doing yoga, or doing things that simulate to their mind that they're accomplishing something, when really they're just tricking their brain into releasing the chemical that it does when you actually get something done. The REAL way is to actually identify the things that stress you out, and REMOVE them from your pile of stressors.\r\n\r\nWhen you make your list, literally write out everything. Pretty much if you think about something and say \"Oh crap, I have to do that.\", it's a stressor. Everything from brushing your teeth in the morning, to changing that light bulb in the laundry room, to gassing up your car, to studying for that test, to out-processing for that deployment, to going to that job interview, etc etc. Write them down, look at it, and think \"Oh shoot, I could just change that lightbulb right now. I could mow the lawn. I could fix that door hinge.\" Do this and you will be on your way to becoming more productive and less stressed. I've been doing this for years now and it works GREAT. It's how these fighter pilots manage their personal lives and flying a stupid fast war machine in combat. There have been a few times where I did still get too stressed out, but it was because I literally just had too much on my plate that was beyond my control, but since I understood how stress works, I was able to still get ahold of it and break myself out of the slight depression I had slipped into.\r\n\r\nFURTHER NOTES:\r\n\r\nTypes of stress:\r\n\r\n-Residual Stress (AKA Emotional Baggage): This type of stress cannot be eliminated, or is VERY difficult to remove. It is things that have happened to you in the past that you drag with you forever. They feel like things you need to \"fix\", but since they're locked in the past, you can't do anything about them, so they cause your stress pile to start out a little higher no matter what you do. You fell on your face that one time at school, or your parents never loved you, or you got stage fright that one time, etc etc. Some people have more than others, and it just always eats at the back of your mind. I have found an awesome way to get over this, but it is using my interpretation of the \"heathen worldview\", which is another tip for another time.\r\n\r\n-Reoccurring Stress: These are things that pop up on a reoccurring basis, such as daily chores, bills, house or work maintenance, etc. They are usually small stressors for people, but since they pop up often, they're always needing to be removed anyways. People often shrug these off, but they can sneak up on you. If you don't take care of the small things, the big things will stack higher, faster. Ever heard the phrase \"the straw that broke the camel's back\"? That straw was probably a Reoccurring Stressor.\r\n\r\n-Time Sensitive Stress: These are stressors that are hanging over your head but cannot be taken care of yet. Your college finals. Job interviews. Upcoming vacation. Etc. They are among the hardest for me to deal with, because they are there, but you can't do them yet. The way to reduce their impact is to ensure you are knocking out the easier stress blocks in the meantime. Change that lightbulb, get your car serviced, mail that package, etc. Another way is to recognize the precursors to that Time Sensitive Stressor, like studying for the college finals, or preparing for the job interview. You will still be knocking things out, being productive, removing stress, and will be better prepared for the TSS when it does arrive.\r\n\r\nA note on Depression:\r\n\r\nThis part of the training has to basically alienate a specific group of people. If you are clinically depressed, then this method may not help you manage your depression because your brain works differently. Depression is where you haven't removed enough stress blocks and so your body says \"screw it\". The danger here is that it will remove your energy, motiviation, etc. By understanding this, you will be able to get back in the saddle, remove some stressors, and get your life back under control. The pilot/instructor went deeply into the phases of depression, and what is known as a \"psychotic break\". Depending on where you are in your depression when you hit your psychotic break, you will lash out in a certain way. Example: if you're in \"inner\", you will hurt/kill yourself. If you're in \"outer\", you will hurt/kill someone else. But what makes it a \"psychotic break\" is that is will be completely bizarre. The example he used was Brittney Spears shaving her head vs. the NASA officer who went to Florida to kidnap her boyfriend's lover. Brittney Spears had much less stress on her life, yet she flew through all the stages of depression and basically hit her psychotic break at a point that caused her to just completely snap and shave her head. The NASA officer underwent a TREMENDOUSLY stressful entire life before finally lashing out at a person who made little to no impact on her overall life. It basically demonstrated how much some people can mentally endure compared to others, and how failure to manage it can cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nA story of my usage of this training:\r\n\r\nI'll make it quick. I was a SSGt in USAF. I was in college full time also. I had orders to the desert. I was a crew lead at my base for my specific job. I had finals for college coming up. In that same week, I had WAPS testing, which is how USAF enlisted troops test for rank. It's a big deal. I ALSO had to out-process for my deployment that week (anyone in can attest to what a stupid pain in the ass that can be). I was super stressed and it got to be too much. But I understood how stress worked. I couldn't make my finals come sooner, nor my WAPS test. Out-processing could be done during work hours. But I still had to lead my crew, which entailed all kinds of bullcrap. So here's what I did. First thing first, I told another NCO on my crew \"Listen man, you're an NCO, you know the ropes, you're the crew lead now.\" I literally just dumped part of my plate onto his, but he was trained/qualified/capable of doing it, and that's literally what he was there for was to lead the crew if I wasn't around. So I just made him the primary and I took the alternate slot. A huge stressor gone. Next, I ensured all my little stuff was taken care of, such as chores/ honey-do's around the house. After that, I made sure I had a dedicated time for WAPS and college studying, so that that stressor didn't bleed into my thoughts all the time. Finally, I made out-processing my primary concern during the work day, so no work-related stressors could pile up. All I had to do was make appointments and knock things off a checklist. This literally saved me from becoming overwhelmed and let me make it through the ordeal. When it was all said and done I did great on my college finals, I didn't make rank (that's OK though, the cutoff score was high for my career that year), and I got to the desert (and back) in one piece. Thanks random fighter pilot on instructor TDY!\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope this helps someone. It has gotten me through a lot, and I share it whenever I can. Take care everyone!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't think of stress as a feeling. Treat it like financial stress. Think of stress as physical blocks stacking up on your life. They key to keeping stress levels down is to REMOVE the blocks. Make a list of stress blocks, and ELIMINATE THEM.

It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.\r\n\r\n> Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary, for these same authors practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of any important part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.\r\n\r\n> These differences blend into each other in an insensible series, and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.\r\n\r\n*such elegance:*\r\n> The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.\r\n\r\n> All that we want to show is that where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming, and this holds good.\r\n\r\n>And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.\r\n\r\n> Hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would decrease\u2014then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation:\r\n\r\n> The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling,\r\n\r\n> special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion,\r\n\r\n> In the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape, whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape.\r\n\r\n> for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males.\r\n\r\n> After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, of anyone ancestor, is only 1 in 2048;\r\n\r\n> If about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the Apteryx.\r\n\r\n> Hence, the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed structures.\r\n\r\n> In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water.\r\n\r\n> How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.\r\n\r\n> The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter, but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked.\r\n\r\n> When thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no part of Mr. Mivart\u2019s plan to give the various facts and considerations opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides.\r\n\r\n> combined, no doubt, in a most important manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of parts,\r\n\r\n> Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis, cannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a distinct answer to such a question, as why some event in the history of mankind did not occur in one country whilst it did in another.\r\n\r\n> If we forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured.\r\n\r\n> But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands.\r\n\r\n> A mountain is an island on the land;\r\n\r\n> With respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded.\r\n\r\n> For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles\r\n\r\n\r\n## Social Darwinism?

Huge Capacatiy:\r\n\r\n    With n dimensions capacity is 2^n\r\n\r\n2. Nearest Neighbor becomes unstable or meaningless\r\n\r\n    With increasing dimensions, the volume increases so fast that available data becomes sparse; distance to nearest neighbor \u2248 to farthest data point \r\n\r\n3. Random vectors are likely almost orthogonal\r\n\r\n4. Low Influence of Noise on Nearest Neighbor Search\r\n\r\n    Since random vectors have the furthest possible distance to each other, noise around a vector is still most likely to be easily identified as the real vector because its distance will be much lower then the other vectors.\r\n\r\n### Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA)\r\n\r\nVector set with a set of the following operations. The operations itself vary depending on the vector space.\r\n\r\n1. Binding \u2297\r\n\r\n    Combine two input vectors into single output vector which *is not similar* to the input vectors but allows to ~ recover any of the given input vectors when the output vector and one of the input vectors is given.\r\n\r\n    Example:  \r\n    N =  name_v \u2297 Alice_v  \r\n    Unbind:  \r\n    name_v \u2297 N  = name_v \u2297 (name_v \u2297 Alice_v) = Alice_v  \r\n    Binding is associative and commutative.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All of them represent a random vector in the vector space. Via \u2297 the 'greater' Vector name_v can be bind to the specific name vector Alice_v and therefore stored in N.\r\n\r\n2. Bundling +\r\n\r\n    Combine two input vectors in single output vector which *is similar* to both input vectors; also called **Superposition of Vectors**.\r\n\r\n    Example:  \r\n    H =  name_v \u2297 Alice_v + birth_v \u2297 1980\r\n\r\n    In this case multiple information which is already binded is bundled together via +, alias superpositioned. We can get specific information by binding with its vector, e.g. searching for the name:\r\n\r\n    name_v \u2297 H = name_v (name_v \u2297 Alice_v + birth_v \u2297 1980)  \r\n    = name_v \u2297 name_v \u2297 Alice_v + name_v \u2297 birth_v \u2297 1980  \r\n    = Alice_v + *noise*\r\n\r\n    This noise can easily be  eliminated by searching for its nearest neighbor which most likely is going to be the vector ALice_v.\r\n\r\n3. Permutation (or Protect) \u03a0\r\n\r\n    Protect vectors if double binded: Prevent Mixing roles and fillers.\r\n\r\n    Example:  \r\n    (A \u2297 X) \u2297 (B \u2297 Y) !Associative and commutative, therefore mixing, better:  \r\n    (A \u2297 X) \u2297 \u03a0(B \u2297 Y)\r\n\r\n    This operator is typically implemented as permutation of vector dimensions.\r\n\r\n### Application to Robotic Tasks\r\n\r\n1. Encoding Real World Data\r\n    * run images through existing CNN for image descriptors and take output from third layer (~70.000 dimensions)\r\n    * locality sensitive hashing to reduce: normal vector from above hyperplanes, then normalized; therefore range from [-1,1] -> multiply-add-permute architectur (see above)\r\n\r\n2. Bundling Views for Object Recognition  \r\n    * task: recognise object from multiple angles\r\n    * bundle multiple view into one vector; therefore a new view only has to be compared against this single vector\r\n\r\n3. Sequence Processing for Place Recognition  \r\n    * task: place recognition with given sequence of previous visited places\r\n    * take image vector as in (2.)\r\n    * replace each in sequence with a bundle of itself an +/- number  of images before and after it\r\n    * each image is bound to static position vector to preserve order of images\r\n    * new sequences can now pairwise compaired with the previous sequence vectors\r\n\r\n    Frage: Ist es nicht insgesamt eher zeitlich gebunden denn Feature?\r\n\r\n3. Learning and Recall of Reactive Behavior  \r\n    * task: learn simple reactive behavior from demonstration (sensor-action-pairs)\r\n    * setup: differential drive robot with left and right distance sensor and central light sensor; goal: drive while avoiding obstacles until light source is found\r\n    * learning procedure: single vector with whole program by combining sensor's condition vector with actuator's result vector; then combine those to in one rule vector; then all rule vectors in one final program vector\r\n    * clean-up memory: actuator-value pair and result vector is stored to recall from noisy vectors\r\n\r\n#### Limitations, Discussions and Open Questions\r\n\r\n* lack of clear definition of VSAs: necessary to know their capabilities\r\n* encoding of real world data into vectors: requirements on properties of encoding/decoding is vital\r\n* connection to probabilistic methods needed\r\n* structured approach to design VSAs missed", "learning_data": 8533, "reference":

retrieve S and then substract PD; probe with difference vector; retrieve E\r\n* this works with longer sequences: use PPC + PD to retrieve E in sequence CDE\r\n* care is needed: after multiple permutations the same bit can appear at its old place\r\n\r\n### Representing Pairs with Mulitplication\r\n\r\n* XOR as operation overperforms because it both commutes and is its own inverse\r\n* avoid by permuting one before combining C = PA \u2295 B\r\n* this is not associative\r\n\r\n### Representing Bindings with Pairs\r\n\r\n* **binding** a variable to a value like value and memory adress\r\n* bound pair of hypervactor is their product-vector H = X \u2295 Y\r\n* **unbinding**: given pair and one of its vector used to retrieve the other by multiplying both X \u2295 H = X \u2295 X \u2295 Y = Y\r\n* in cognitive modeling: variables are _roles_, values are _fillers_\r\n\r\n### Representing Data Records with Sets of Bound Pairs\r\n\r\n* **bundling** operator\r\n* combine several role-filler pairs into single entity H = X \u2295 A + Y \u2295 B + Z \u2295 C\r\n* each information can be unbound as above X \u2295 H = X \u2295 (X \u2295 A + Y \u2295  B + Z \u2295 C) = XXA + XYB + XZC = A + R1 + R2\r\n* Rs being random noise;

Sales is a conversation, marketing is a broadcast. Marketing gets the phone to ring, sales takes the call and closes the deal.\r\n\r\n> For B2B sales resembles project management: the goal is not to convince everyone to buy your product or service but to diagnose their needs and only engage with firms that will benefit.\r\n\r\n> For larger deals you \"sell with your ears\" as much as you talk.\r\n\r\n> I find Neil Rackham's \"Spin Selling\" very useful. Peter Cohan's \"Great Demo\" embeds a lot of discovery advice and suggests that a good demo is really a conversation driven by mutual curiosity about customer needs and software capabilities.\r\n\r\n> For B2B customer development interviews (those early market discovery conversations) I have a short book you may find helpful. See [Link](https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2020/01/30/40-tips-for-b2b-customer-development-interviews/) (there is also a link at the bottom for a PDF version).\r\n\r\n> Two final books I would suggest, while not exactly sales books, are \"The Innovator's DNA\" by Clayton Christensen and \"The Right It (Pretotype It)\" by Alberto Savoia. They cover a number of techniques for finding the right problem to solve and determining if your solution is a good fit for customer needs.

Yikes.\r\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough for Lexus, a few early customers reported some minor, non-safety issues with their cruise control.\r\n\r\nAnd by \"a few\" customers, I mean... two. Not 2,000.

And Germany\u2019s warmongering was getting scary - France had fallen, the USSR and USA were both neutral so far, and only Britain was left to stand against the nazis.\r\n\r\nAs he said years later, he believed he had to do something for the good of humanity. Even though, by all accounts, he was a nobody - just a hotel clerk and failed chicken farmer, who\u2019d briefly served on both sides of the spanish civil war, leaving with a dislike of Fascism and Communism both.\r\n\r\nSo Juan, naturally, decided to become a spy, and fuck over Hitler as hard as he could. Logical career move for a hotel clerk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. But the british, who he wanted to help, weren\u2019t interested - he\u2019d asked to help at the embassy in madrid several times. The brits were all like \u201cwho are you? Actually never mind we don\u2019t care you can\u2019t do shit to help us and we don\u2019t really trust you, so scram.\u201d\r\n\r\nJuan, of course, was undeterred. He decided that the nazis had to be destroyed, and he figured if would be easier to do so from within. So he reinvents himself as a fanatically fascist government official and applies to \u201chelp\u201d the germans spy on the brits, claiming he has a way to actually get undercover to britain to spy on them. All of this is utter bullshit, of course.\r\n\r\nThe germans say \u201cuh sure we could use the help,\u201d and hire him. Since he can\u2019t get to britain, he goes to lisbon portugal, frequenting the library to learn about britain so he can convincingly just Make Shit Up. He sends the German navy on a wild goose chase for a nonexistent naval convoy at the Mediterranean island of Malta. The germans are convinced he\u2019s the best spy they have in britain. After all, the rest of them keep getting captured, except for the ones Garcia is recruiting. Or, rather, inventing. His recruits were as real as the maltese convoy, which is to say, not even a little real. They did make good fall guys to blame when his \u201cintel\u201d was off.\r\n\r\nThe brits meanwhile are looking for him, since the german codes they were breaking showed the germans allegedly had a spy setting up a spy ring in britain. But then they read his messages - Juan allegedly had a scottish contact who \u201cwould do anything for a litre of wine\u201d\r\n\r\nThat tipped the brits off that someone was just fucking with German intel. I mean, metric system, anyone? A scotsman who drinks WINE?! unrealistic.\r\n\r\nSo eventually the lisbon british embassy tipped off MI6 that this guy in lisbon was trying to tell them he was literally a german intelligence agent and would like to help fight the nazis please.\r\n\r\nSo they brought him to britain, and gave him the codename Agent Garbo. He teamed up with mI6 where he continued to bullshit the nazis with a combination of pure lies, true but useless intel, and useful intel that arrived just a bit too late to help the germans at all.\r\n\r\nHe convinced the germans D-Day was a feint, not the main allied invasion. That would come farther east at Calais, he convinced the germans. The First US Army Group led by General Patton would lead it.\r\n\r\nThe first US army group was made of divisions that didn\u2019t exist, in an empty base, with inflated fake tanks and airplanes to convince german planes flying above dover think it was legit.\r\n\r\nThe Germans kept a large number of troops and tank divisions back at calais, to repel an invasion force which never landed. These troops could have stopped the allied landings at Normandy. Instead they sat at Calais, doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Germans gave Pujol the Iron Cross 2nd class for his essential aid to the nazi regime. The British government soon after made him a Member of the Order of the British empire.\r\n\r\nHis German spy handler gave him his iron cross in person after the war, apologizing profusely for failing to win the war he\u2019d helped them so much with.\r\n\r\nI imagine it was difficult to keep a straight face for that conversation.", "learning_data": 10124, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 1965, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Sales/Con Man Advice", "content": "LUSTIG\u2019S TEN COMMANDMENTS OF THE CON\r\n\r\n* Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast talking, that gets a con-man his coups).\r\n* Never look bored.\r\n* Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them.\r\n* Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones.\r\n* Hint at sex talk, but don\u2019t follow it up unless the other fellow shows a strong interest.\r\n* Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown.\r\n* Never pry into a person\u2019s personal circumstances (they\u2019ll tell you all eventually).\r\n* Never boast.

Maybe when the iLasercutter app comes to Android.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, start by making the piece on the left of OP's image, the tails. Don't make the thinnest part too thin, the angles too weird or the remains too close (which will make the other piece thins too thin). If you want it pretty much the same on both sides, cheat and clamp the boards together and cut them at the same time. For your first few tries, use same thickness wood and have the depth of the cut be the thickness of the wood.\r\n\r\nNow, clamp and saw to the cutline. The trick is to beat your brain into submission. It is going to be screaming, \"Cut square to the wood!\" but you want to cut to the angle of the line you drew. Don't worry if you're not perfect to your drawn line, it'll look planned fancy with the tails a little different.\r\n\r\nYou've sawn the tails, next step is to sharpen your chisels. This thread will still be here later; go spend a month of your life learning to sharpen your hand tools (humor, but no joke). Now that you have sharp chisels, get the widest chisel you have that is shorter than what you're cutting and use firm but gentle strokes to rive the cut line. Take your time, let the chisel know you're working, but you're cutting wood, not forming cold steel. Don't smack the whatever out of that poor chisel, it'll just get mad and bite you or the wood or both.\r\n\r\nNow we cheat a little. Get a coping saw and patiently remove most of the waste. Then get your chisel that you haven't used for anything else, especially not opening metal finish cans, and carefully chisel the little niblet of waste away. The key is patience. If you're not patient you're liable to become a patient.\r\n\r\nSo, these lines we just cut were drawn on the face grain. Now we take the piece we just cut and draw those lines onto the end grain of the other piece. We can't cut this part two at once. In fact, many drawers only have a dovetail for the front of the drawer because that is where the strength is needed. Especially in the summer after making the drawer fit a smidge snug in the winter.\r\n\r\nNow we want to keep the blade square to the flat of the (endgrain) wood, but cut the angle line we drew. We need turn on the part of our \"Cut square!\" brain we turned off before and turn off the other such part that has a cow for the angle we are cutting. Chisel a riven score, coping saw, chisel away nibs like before.\r\n\r\nHopefully every thing has gone well up to now. The initial fit. Ideally it doesn't fit. You want it to be a bit too tight so you can sand down to good fit. Be patient and sand to fit. Chiselling or sawing will lead to kindling.\r\n\r\nHow tight? If you're going to be gluing, you want it loose enough you can put it together and take it appart by hand without a soft mallet. If no glue but otherwise permanent, tight enough that you need to tap it into final place with a soft mallet - gentle taps, mind you. If it is going to be frequently assembled / dissassembled, you want to have to smack it together with your hands. (When you're in the field, feel free to be gentle with soft mallet to avoid pinching.\r\n\r\nYou're mixing end grain and face grain. The two types of grain will look different after finishing. This is as it should be. If any lout comments on a poor finish job because of this the only place they deserve wood is upside the head. It is probably a hard head, so use the edge of a double-wide LVL engineered lumber plank to minimize damage to wood.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt other will chime in too. I'm not the best at explaining things that I know how to do. The best is to see this done in person, but, well, COVID.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "learning_data": 9672, "reference": [1462]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2071, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "car: Ultima in the snow", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/carporn/comments/iz248v/took_my_ultima_out_in_the_snow_did_some_skids/>\r\n\r\n![Yellow Ultima front view](https://preview.redd.it/zsndkh8aw4p51.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=2df4a895721f41359aaeced98febe95cd14593e0)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nInspired the low poly models project somewhat", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2072, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "1972 Maserati Boomerang \u2013 Steering Wheel", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/WeirdWheels/comments/iycli3/1972_maserati_boomerang_steering_wheel/>", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2073, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "list: Are we all moral criminals for making addictive systems?", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/ixx4zz/are_we_all_moral_criminals_for_making_addictive/>", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2074, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "list: Advanced Programming/Development Channels", "content": "Brackeys was so valuable in my Unity journey. For beginners out there wondering what other YouTube channels might be valuable, here are a few I follow. Most them are 2d, but a lot have 3d tutorials as well. Posting from my phone, so it might need some edits!\r\n\r\nGamesPlusJames - One of my faves. Amazing tutorial series, good udemy content. His 2d Snow Bros YouTube Series was what brought me out of tutorial hell and helped me build the foundational skills for 2d games. Its the YouTube series I recommend for any friends looking to get into 2d Unity.\r\n\r\nAlex Zotov - Straightforward short focused tutorials, mostly for beginners.\r\n\r\nCode Monkey - mix of intermediate topics - has some tutorial series.\r\n\r\nBlackthornprod - Focus on art, design, and code. He's got some gold tutorials. His turned based tactics game Udemy course is also solid.\r\n\r\nCouch Ferret - Amazing 2d tutorial series, with focus on movement, aiming, etc. Very clear explanations.\r\n\r\nFirst Gear Games - focused on unity online multiplayer. Great deep dives. Beginner friendly. Also looks at other topics. Underrated channel.\r\n\r\nLost Relic Games - Mix of 2d fundamentals and broad unity discussion\r\n\r\nTurbo Makes Games - 2d, 3D, DOTS, and provides clear explanations.\r\n\r\nTom Weiland - Amazing Multiplayer Tutorial series as he navigates building his own multiplayer game. There's not a lot of multiplayer development channels, so I'm stoked when I find ones with good content.\r\n\r\nxzippyzachx - Branching off of Tom's tutorial series, and working on his own multiplayer.\r\n\r\nQuill18 Creates - Tutorial series, multiplayer, intermediate topics, and he does a lot of game jams and breakdowns\r\n\r\nUnity3dCollege - want to go from beginner to intermediate/advanced? Check out Jason's channel. Focused on strong coding conventions and patterns, it really can help level up your skills.\r\n\r\nSebastian Legue - seems quite popular. I've followed some of his tutorials to solve a few issues complex topics.\r\n\r\nInfallible Code - focused on more advanced topics, and good coding practices. Also some solid podcast episodes talking about coding and unity in general.\r\n\r\nBinary Lunar - Animation, Shaders, Movement, and other topics\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n[Edit] /u/MikePounce - Recommended Channels:\r\n\r\nJonas Tyroller - General tips about making your game and making it fun & appealing\r\n\r\nThe Game Dev Guru - Optimization and advanced techniques, the real treasure is his website https://thegamedev.guru/\r\n\r\nGame Dev Guide - Very nice tutorials, in-depth explanation of techniques you see in AAA games, highly recommended as a successor to Brackey", "learning_data": null, "reference": [1908]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2075, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Lamborghini Athon interior/dash", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/9juc9a/the_lamborghini_athon_was_posted_earlier_but_its/>\r\n\r\n![Retro Leather Interior with weird digital elements](https://preview.redd.it/gqxj4x4zc4p11.jpg?width=540&auto=webp&s=12889909a2e28fedef11482de4d160ff234065fb)", "learning_data": 11028, "reference": [1464, 2076]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2076, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "1986 Z31 dash", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/c3wgvy/got_me_a_1986_z31_with_80k_miles_the_digital_dash/>", "learning_data": 11029, "reference": [1464, 2075]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2077, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "list: US Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) Youtube channel", "content": "You'll love the US Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) Youtube channel.\r\n\r\nIt basically dissects massive explosions at chemical plants.

I mostly want to build my own knowledge base which fills just the spots that i lack or wish to improve on. Ultimately, I want to remember my notes so that i don't have to look up things as often.\r\n\r\n*Do you ahve different strategies for taking notes in a lecture and taking notes from a book*\r\n- not really\r\n\r\n*Do you realize notes can be formatted in different ways*\r\n- Yeah. There is markdown, which im using currently, there are context maps, which i eventually want to get into, theres anki and so on. For lectures there are also a number of different formats, but i haven't looked into those (they probably would be helpful for youtube)\r\n\r\n*Do you re-write your notes*\r\n- I rewrite a lot initially, after that only when i find a more concise way to represent something\r\n\r\n*If you re-write your notes, do you simply copy them out again, or do you write them in different words, or in a different format?*\r\n- I tend to collapse multiple chapters that are related into one file, and shortening that file alot. Don't know if thats a good thing though, especially if you haven't read everything there is about a topic\r\n\r\n*How do you review your notes?*\r\n- Honestly, only when I need them. I should probably set times for when i actively read my notes, even when im not doing something related to them\r\n\r\n*How do you review your notes?*\r\n- Reading them repeatedly, mostly\r\n\r\n*Do you have a clear idea of what you want to get out of a text or lecture beforehand?*\r\n- Most of the time, but I could use a cooler head when looking into new topics. I tend to save to much reference material and loose myself in unnessecary details instead of looking at the broader picture first\r\n\r\n*In a lecture, do you try to take down everything*\r\n- Everything that i deem important, yes\r\n\r\n*Do you ahve trouble picking out whats important ina  text or lecture?*\r\n- It can happen with complex stuff\r\n\r\n*Do you believe that successful students are simply more intelligent than less successful students?*\r\n- You can have an edge in some specific topics, but mostly it comes down to dedication and the way you spend your time studying exactly, i guess\r\n\r\n*Do you cram efore an exam rather than study regularly?*\r\n- sadly, yes\r\n\r\n*Do you find information only seems to stay in your memory for a short time?*\r\n- Yes\r\n\r\n*Do you have trouble concentrating?*\r\n- Yes\r\n\r\n*Do you have trouble sitting still in one place for long?*\r\n- Mostly, but there are some days where its fine\r\n\r\n*Do you have trouble holding sufficient information in your head to understand whats being said?*\r\n- Yes\r\n\r\n*Do you have different strategies you use for different types of information or when you have different purposes?*\r\n- Not activily, no\r\n\r\n*When you started this book, did you study the Table of Contents for a few minutes, reflecting on the various topics indicated there?*\r\n- No\r\n- Okay im going back to look at it :D\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 1. Introduction\r\n\r\n<mark>Effectiveness is King</mark>. Forget:\r\n- Smarty-Pants\r\n- Hours put in\r\n\r\nYou need to understand:\r\n- why, when & how it works\r\n- when it doesn't work\r\n- how to use it\r\n- your own learning style\r\n- that you need to **practice** note taking\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 2. Making note-taking an effective strategy\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- Why is note-taking effective?\r\n- What can limit its effectiveness?\r\n\r\nYou can either rephrase texts/lectures (*taking* notes) or write down your thoughts (*make* notes).\r\n\r\n## Why is note-taking effective?\r\n\r\nAlthough remembering information is important, <mark>the main benefit of note-taking is the *act* of doing it</mark>, because you force yourself to rephrase/restructure and organize the information in your head.\r\n\r\nTaking notes makes the information **meaningful** to you.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of note-taking depends on:\r\n- its style (dry vs informal)\r\n- its organization\r\n- its complexity\r\n- its density\r\n- your skill\r\n- your strategy\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## The importance of working memory\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about comprehension is a good *working memory* (`WM`).\r\n\r\n<mark>Our WM stores and retrieves information from memory and has very limited resources</mark>. The act of **encoding**, storing something it in long-term memory, is mostly an active process, meaning that we have to work on it.\r\n\r\nA WMs resources depend on two parts:\r\n- Your working memory *capacity* (`WMC`)\r\n- Your ability to eliminate *competing demands*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Memory Capacity\r\n\r\n**Your WMC is how many things your WM can hold at once**. It correlates highly to `fluid intelligence`, which refers to general reasoning and problem solving skills.  \r\nBecause of this, a bigger WMC is better for text comprehensions since your brain can make more connections. Lower WMC pushes you to use less effective learning strategies because they are less demanding.\r\n\r\nThe WM usually holds information *acoustically*, so one chunk of information  (one `item`) usually corresponds to about 2 seconds of speech.\r\n\r\nEven though it can hold multiple items, **our WM can only have one *focus of attention* at any given moment**. There can, however, be a few items in a state of readiness, so circulating your focus between these items can increase your WMC.  \r\n\r\nSince there are seperate WMs for `verbal` and `visiospatial` information, you have two options to reduce the amount of items you have to remember:\r\n- grouping similar information (`chunking`), and\r\n- splitting items between WMs\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Competing demands\r\n\r\n**Any form of interference in your WM can limit your capacity considerably**. The biggest source of interference is, apart from your physical environment, your own thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nAny thought that is not direcly about the information in the text or lecture at hand is a *competing demand*. Thoughts about what you want to do later, or simply thinking about your goal take up space in your WM.  \r\n\r\nIn a text or lecture, interference can also simply come in the form of unimportant information. The way its presented can also be critical, especially when the material is more complex. The catchphrase here is *cognitive load*.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# PART I: Selection strategies\r\n\r\n**Anything that helps you select the most important information is good**. And whatever strategy you pick, it can be practiced.\r\n\r\nGood selection skills build the foundation for all skills associated with studying and can be seen as *the essence of intelligence*.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to select, you need a certain degree of backround knowledge, or otherwise everything will be important to you. \r\n\r\nSome texts are also more demanding and require a higher degree of focus to pick out the gold.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 3. Highlighting\r\n\r\nHighlighting shifts your attention to the selected words at the expense of the rest of the text. This is only effective if:\r\n- the text is long enough for your attention to need guidance,\r\n- you don't already know the selected details, and\r\n- the highlights are uniformly styled\r\n\r\nHighlighting is an unsuited strategy if\r\n- there are too many important bits, or\r\n- the information can't be conveyed briefly  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nSo in essence, highlighting is **mostly useful if the topic is either familiar of if its relatively simple**.  \r\n**However**, you can reduce the amount of important bits by limiting youself to a question you want to answer.\r\n\r\nIts enough to highlight parts of sentences or only catchphrases, since you can infer the context most of the time. And if not, you have to read the rest of the sentence anyway, so it reduces visual distraction.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## What should be highlighted\r\n\r\nIn a suited text, there are two rules of thumb:\r\n- Restrict your highlighting to 10% of the text, or one sentence per paragraph\r\n- Mark details you want to remember but don't think you will\r\n\r\nYou should not highlight when:\r\n- The text is too dense. But in these cases it can be used as a stepping stone for other strategies\r\n- You are low on time. Highlighting requires you to spend some time with the text to figure out what should be marked\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nHighlighting is an effective strategy\r\n- as an aid for concentration\r\n- when you have no time pressure\r\n- when the text is either of relatively low density or when you are familiar with the material\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 4. Headings highlight structure\r\n\r\n**Headings establish the main idea of the section that follows them**. \r\n\r\nJust as summaries, headings can be categorized as **organizational signals**. They emphasize the topics of a text and their structure, which is different from highlighting.\r\n\r\nHeadings help you remember more topics, at the potential cost of remembering less about each topic in detail. Details that relate directly to a heading are more likely to be remembered than unrelated ones. Additionally summarizing each header with a short bullet point or sentence can help you break down an otherwise complicated text.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a broad overwiev of a topic with a solid understanding of the topic at hand justifies the loss of some details.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## How Headings effects Decoding and Encoding of Information\r\n\r\nIn unstructured text, these parts tend to be recalled better:\r\n- items that are mentioned directly at the start or end\r\n- items which you are familiar with\r\n- items discussed at greater length\r\n\r\nSo structuring the text with headings can help you avoid these unwanted tendencies. In structured text, the length of the discussed item is least effected, meaning that you should write about the important bits in greater detail.\r\n\r\nThe topic structure is mostly a **encoding** strategy. However, decoding is just as important as encoding. Because of this, it seems beneficial to put headings not only where a transition of topics occure, but also on topics that you want to recall later on. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## The topic structuge strategy\r\n\r\nTexts in which the information follows a logical order, are both easy to understand and remember. If you summarize a text, it's better to **rearrange the information** in small packets **under fitting headings**, in such a way that the flow of information makes sense to you. This is called the topic structure strategy.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### When are headings helpful\r\n\r\nIn short, headings have the following positives:\r\n- Good headings help you select the most important information\r\n- Good headings help you see the structure of the text\r\n- text structure helps you organize your notes\r\n\r\nThey are most useful when\r\n- the text has several topics and is not clearly organized\r\n- there are no other cues to structure and detail importance\r\n- the reader needs assistance with structure or importance of details\r\n\r\nWrite headings when\r\n- you find a text confusing\r\n- a text has too many topics\r\n- you can't hold all the information in your head\r\n\r\nPay attention to the headings provided by the text but don't hesitate to re-write them if they are not useful to you. To asses whether headings are used in a text are of value to you, ask yourself\r\n- do they highlight the main points and themes?\r\n- do they provide meaningful connections between topics?\r\n- do they provide good retrival cues?\r\n- in the absence of good headings, use signal words to identify the text structure\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 5: Summaries\r\n\r\nSummaries lie at the heart of note-taking. Its **the most important skill you can learn**.\r\n\r\nPersonal note:  \r\nIts okay for a summary to be a whole paragraph of text with no bullet points. The information just needs to be presented on a very basic level and well connected.\r\n\r\nAs with highlightings and headings, you have to distinguish between summaries that you create and summaries that are provided for you, since the goals of the author almost certainly are different from yours. \r\n\r\nHowever, they are useful as **guidelines** as to what is important. This, for example, is very important for priming.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Priming: Reading the text is not the first step\r\n\r\nOrder\r\n- Read summary/overview\r\n- Reflect, think about infos, get in the right head-space\r\n- ask yourself: **What do i need to know?**, what do i expect to learn?\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure what you need from the text, you'll read it simply with the hope that the right information will pop out at you. **This is a huge waste of time**. Putting in the time beforehand will save your hours or even days afterwards.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the summary, frame the essence of the text in or or two sentences at most, ignoring all the details you don't understand at the moment. If you can't do you it, you didn't undetstand the heart of the matter.\r\n\r\nNow, still looking at the overview, start focusing on the details. **Any details mentioned in an overview are important, otherwise they wouldn't be included**. Pause at every detail, think shortly about whether you actually know what it means, **think on the knowledge that gets dragged up**, make the connections. If you don't know a detail, don't panic. Chances are that it will be explained in the text, so for now its sufficient to just make a note (mental or physical) and look for the answer in the text. You can also guess or infer the answer from the context and write that down to check later down the road if you were correct. If, after reading the text, you deem a detail unimportant, you shouldn't look up what it means. **Don't get bogged down in details that don't matter**. Figuring out whether a detail is important or not is half the battle. Wikipedia is great at providing brief descriptions that are good enough to work with.\r\n\r\nWhats important is that if you already know/understand some details of the text, **use them to connect the text to your memory, to aid you remembering it later on**. \r\n\r\nAt this point you have\r\n- dragged up relevant information about this topic from your past memory\r\n- a list of questions you want answered\r\n- a list of details you don't yet understand\r\n\r\nYou can now go on an read the text.\r\n\r\nIf no overview is provided, look at the summary at the end. If there is not summary, scan the text for headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Types of summaries\r\n\r\nThe most common type of summary is the **topical summary**, which often provides the main points in a string of facts at the end of a chapter. A topical summary at the start of a chapter is called an **overview**.\r\n\r\nThere are also other types, like graphic summaries, which are often used to outline the sections of a text. Putting these at the start of a chapter is called an advance organizer.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Topical summaries and overviews\r\n\r\n**Can also be seen as organizational signals**, since they provide your with a structure.\r\n\r\nThey make reading a text faster, and easier to follow along (e.g. with lectures).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Advance organizers\r\n\r\nAdvance organizers differ from summaries or overviews in their puropose: they aim to put what you are about to read into **context**, not worrying as much about the details.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, they are written with a higher level of abstraction and often mention things which do not appear in the text that follows them.\r\n\r\nThey are usually provided by the teacher or writer, but you can write your own **after** reading the text.\r\n\r\nSince the effectiveness of an advance organizer obviously depends on whether the reader actually knows the context it tries to weave into, simple and concrete examples are preferred to abstracters ones if possible.\r\n\r\n**Reflecting** on the provided information shortly before reading the the text that follows it increases the effect of the advance organizer. Or simply put: If one is provided, use it! And then think about it! And, same as with summaries, if you don't understand something, don't panic and think of simpler examples that fit the same description.\r\n\r\nWriting your own is a good exercise. Similar to taking notes in general, it gives the text a personal meaning. This can be compared to writing a high-level abstract.\r\n\r\n## Main Points\r\n\r\nmain points that i didn't mention:\r\n- topical summaries have the same functions and disadvantages as headings\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Creating summaries\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n- ignoring the unimportant information and filtering out whats important is the most critical skill for writing summaries.\r\n- copy-delete (only copying out the sentences the you deem important) is not a good strategy, because whats important can change later on. main ideas are also rarely contained in a single sentence, which is why they are structured in paragraphes.\r\n- this is why priming is so important, because you try to answer q concrete question\r\n\r\nWhat do i want to learn:\r\n- how to effectivily formulate questions in topics which are new to me?\r\n- how to not get lost in the details of a new topic?\r\n- how do i construct summaries as i read the text? \r\n\r\nYou start to summarize the text **after** you've read it.\r\n\r\nThe best summaries are written without references to the text.\r\n\r\nPersonal take:  \r\nStopping to write notes while reading your text **stops the flow of information**, and activily works against your working memory. So it only makes sense to read the entire text first.\r\n\r\nAfter priming, read the text normally and reflect whether your view on the text has changed. Adopt accordingly and repeat, until you understand what the text is about. After that, write the summary.\r\n\r\nIf you get stuck with the details, you can use these steps as a guideline to make the text more simple:\r\n- remove trivial information\r\n- remove redundant information\r\n- group list of facts under a superordinate term\r\n- summarize the topic with a single sentence\r\n\r\nStrategic reading is the only way to fully understand a complex text. After you **extracted** the main idea, group secondary ideas by grouping and labeling paragraphs that belong together.\r\n\r\nDONT GET HUNG UP ON THE DETAILS GOD DAMNIT\r\n\r\n**Generally generalize things. Always put things in your own words Extract and Abstract**.\r\n\r\nSummaries are better when they are not bound to the original text. After reading and reflecting it, close the text, take a short break, and only then write the summary. Don't reference the original text if not neccessary.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n- prime\r\n- read\r\n- reflect\r\n- if too complex, simplify\r\n- extract and abstract main, and then secondary ideas\r\n- check\r\n\r\n1.) Prime\r\n- answer all questions you've made\r\n\r\n2.) dissect the text, paragraph per paragraph\r\n- create topic sentences/headings without repeating information that was included in topic sentences or main/secondary ideas that were formulated before. it normally takes multiple sentences from the paragraph as input\r\n- topic sentences **are** the secondary ideas, since you've already formulated your main idea before.\r\n- you don't need to construct a topic sentence for each paragraph. you need to recognize whats important\r\n- if a detail doesn't make sense, look how often it is mention in the rest of the text and then judge whether you need to include it or not\r\n \r\nAs with highlighting, select the details that you want to remember, but don't think you will. You are only recording everything that you **need help to remember**. Write just enough to help you cue remember all the linked details.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nIf you think about this this approach, you spend more time checking whether you understood the text, most of which didn't get translated into notes.\r\n\r\n**The more you understand, the less notes you will have**.\r\n\r\nA good summary:\r\n- is short \r\n- contains only, and all, important information\r\n- is in your own words\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# 6: Graphic summaries\r\n\r\n## Outlines vs graphic organizers\r\n\r\nGraphic organizers excell at providing relationships between information, as long as they don't contain too many details. They should only be used for displaying hierachical information.\r\n\r\nThey also use the visual part of the working memory more, which splits up the workload with the auditory memory nicely. Because of this, they are easier to process. (auditory WM is triggered when reading text, since we read the text out loud in our inner mind). Using these two memory types together also increases the changes of recalling the information later.\r\n\r\nWhen worked with correctly (when time was spent with them), the information conveyed lasts for a much longer time period compared to a text-based outline. \r\n\r\nHowever, they are not always useful. For short texts, outlines work just as well as visual organizers in terms of recall performance and on top of that are easier to create.\r\n\r\nIn summary, outlines are suited for learning facts of a short text, but graphic organizers help build understanding. Since you should keep the organizers lean, its helpful to split organizers up into multiple organizers as the text gets longer or more complex.\r\n\r\nBoth however do not a good way to provide full notes.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Constructing outline or graphic organizers\r\n\r\nConstructing a graphic organizer\r\n- Divide your text into passages of around 1500 words\r\n- Outline the main ideas in the passage\r\n- Choose a graphical organizer format that fits the structure of the information\r\n- Fit your main ideas into the format\r\n- If it doesn't work, reconsider the structure of the information\r\n- Try again!\r\n\r\nCommon formats include trees, matrices or flowcharts. When none of these fit, make it your own!\r\n\r\nNote that graphic organizers are only useful for displaying hierarchical information.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Multimedia summaries\r\n\r\nSummary that combines visual and verbal format. The Verbal part needs to be kept to a minimum. Pictures and text need to be tightly integrated.\r\n\r\nMultimedia summaries are good at for information that involves cause & effect relationships.\r\n\r\nAs with graphic organizers: As soon as the garphic gets to big, split up the graphic into multiple parts.\r\n\r\nThree golden rules:\r\n- Be very concise\r\n- Very little text\r\n- coordinate words and images\r\n\r\nOr in other words:\r\n- concise: small number of words & simple illustrations\r\n- coherent: cause-effect chain\r\n- coordinated: text is integrated\r\n\r\nOutlines, graphical organizers and multimedia summaries all reduce the load on working memory. So use them, especially if you have a low working memory.\r\n\r\nHowever, as with all illustrations, you need to work with them in order for them to be useful. For this, you can create a series of simple habits that make you integrate the image with the text in a structured manner. These statements can be categorized into 3 categories:\r\n- encourage text processing\r\n    - study title when openening new page\r\n    - carefully re-read paragraphs when finishing the text\r\n    - search for references in precious paragraphes when finishing one\r\n- encourage image processing\r\n    - study picture first when opening a new page\r\n    - search for central elements in regards to content\r\n    - put central elements into context with one another\r\n- encourage integration\r\n    - search picture for related content when reading a paragraph\r\n    - search text for related content after looking at image\r\n    - after finishing the text, carefully study image again to verify understanding\r\n\r\nOf course, you can create your own or only use the ones you need assistance with, but its important to cover these three main categories.\r\n\r\nDon't shy away from rewriting, -drawing, or -phrase the diagram. The more things you put into your own words, the better.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\n\r\nMaps use the visualspatial part of your working memory and prioritize the relationship between elements more than the elements themselves. Like any graphic, they reduce the load on your working memory. However, this onky applies if the number of elements is kept to a minimum. Research shows that 12-16 elements is the maximum.\r\n\r\nAny information can be put into maps, for example lists of elements can be remembered better when represented as an arbitrary map. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Visual language\r\n\r\nAnything that combines text and images can be considered a visual language, and as such should have a grammar that should be followed to make it as easy to understand as possible.\r\n\r\nIn general, the information should be chunked in blocks (like paragraphs), related to a single main point and labeled clearly. Keep everything as consistent and short as possible.\r\n\r\nSince labels integrate the images with the text, they are the part you should put the most effort into. Make sure that the labels could stand on their own, like topic summaries or advance organizers.", "learning_data": 10019, "reference": [2542]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2545, "fields": {"profile": 1628, "title": "Gieb Money", "content": "MoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoney", "learning_data": 10558, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2557, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "idea: Cranfield Index Method x Icon Search Engine", "content": "* test which icons user expect regarding what icon\r\n* make a *good* icon search (or propose one)\r\n\r\n`blog`", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 2568, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "list: Medienapplikationen", "content": "## Vor welchem Grundproblem steht man bei der Einf\u00fchrung von Interaktion im TV-Bereich?\r\n\r\n\r\n* unidirektionaler Cast\r\n\r\n## Welche interaktive, video-basierte Formate gibt es?\r\n\r\n* Aspen Movie Map\r\n* Dragon's Lair: Videospiele mit linearem Plot, wo der Spieler an Punkten Entscheidungen treffen\r\n\r\n## Welche Konzepte und Ideen gab es, um Interaktion im analogen Fernsehen zu realisieren?\r\n\r\n* lokale Interaktion: Inhalte auf Abruf, erweiterte Programmwahl\r\n* Interaktion per R\u00fcckkanal: Lichttest, Call-In, Abstimmung, Hugo - Steuerung per Telefon\r\n* Teilnahme: Talentshows\r\n\r\n## Was bezeichnen die Begriffe Web-TV, IPTV und Smart-TV?\r\n\r\n**IPTV**:\r\n\r\n* Quality of Service\r\n* geschlossenes Netz\r\n\r\n**Web-TV**:\r\n\r\n* kein QOS\r\n* offenes Netz (oft Internet)\r\n* wie Netflix\r\n\r\n**Smart-TV**:\r\n\r\n* Internetf\u00e4higkeit eines TV-Ger\u00e4ts\r\n\r\n## Welche Grundkonzepte zur Realisierung von Interaktion im digitalen TV-Bereich sind m\u00f6glich?\r\n\r\n* \u201cIch f\u00fcr mich\u201d, d.h. meine Entscheidungen bzw.

If you get to work on a project involving Mongodb, spend some extra time and effort to get Mongodb under your belt. If you get a project for a law firm, spend some extra time thinking about how to develop applications that deal with contracts or boilerplates or PDF generation or document management.\r\n\r\n(4) Raise your rates.\r\n\r\n(5) Start refusing hourly-rate projects. Your new minimum billable increment is a day.\r\n\r\n(6) Take end-to-end responsibility for the business objectives of whatever you build. This sounds fuzzy, like, \"be able to talk in a board room\", but it isn't! It's mechanically simple and you can do it immediately: Stop counting hours and days. Stop pushing back when your client changes scope. Your remedy for clients who abuse your flexibility with regards to scope is \"stop working with that client\". Some of your best clients will be abusive and you won't have that remedy. Oh well! Note: you are now a consultant.\r\n\r\n(7) Hire one person at a reasonable salary. You are now responsible for their payroll and benefits. If you don't book enough work to pay both your take-home and their salary, you don't eat. In return: they don't get an automatic percentage of all the revenue of the company, nor does their salary automatically scale with your bill rate.\r\n\r\n(8) You are now \"senior\" or \"principal\". Raise your rates.\r\n\r\n(9) Generalize out from your specialties: Mongodb -> NoSQL -> highly scalable backends. Document management -> secure contract management.\r\n\r\n(10) Raise your rates.\r\n\r\n(11) You are now a top-tier consulting group compared to most of the market. Market yourself as such. Also: your rates are too low by probably about 40-60%.\r\n\r\nTry to get it through your head: people who can simultaneously (a) crank out code (or arrange to have code cranked out) and (b) take responsibility for the business outcome of the problems that code is supposed to solve - people who can speak both tech and biz - are exceptionally rare.

I\u2019ve been working with 7 Habits since 1995, and teaching it to others. So please allow me to present a pretty thorough summary.\r\n\r\nAs some readers of this answer may not have read the book, I\u2019ll begin with a summary of what a principle is.\r\n\r\n**What Is a Principle?**\r\n\r\nA principle is an operant law of the universe, an absolute fact of how things work. The laws of physics, such as the laws of motion and gravity, are examples. Covey, and many other philosophers, propose that there are laws that are just as absolute that create consequences of human intentional actions and human errors. To be an effective athlete, one must run, jump, and fall down well. That is, one must deal with the laws of motion and gravity. If we don\u2019t do it well - by intent or by clumsy error - we get hurt. As Covey says, we cannot break a principle, we cannot break a natural law; we can only break ourselves upon it.\r\n\r\nSo, get these wrong, and we hurt ourselves, or, at least, miss achieving our goals. That means that understanding these principles and working in accordance with them is essential to being effective, to achieving our goals in life.\r\n\r\nThe principle itself exists, and statements of the principles are approximations of the principle. Just as Newton\u2019s, and even Einstein\u2019s, descriptions of motion and gravity are not motion and gravity themselves, so any words that describe a principle may be partly on target, and not full and accurate. As we grow in 7 Habits, we find that there are many ways to state each principle. We find our favorite words and use them to remind us of the principle that lies beneath. Then we live by these principles simply because they work.\r\n\r\nPrinciples are not values. Whatever we value: Love, or friendship, or athletic achievement, or money, living by principles will help us achieve our goals in life and experience value in life.\r\n\r\n**Categories of Principles for Effective People**\r\n\r\nWe can break the principles of effective living down into six groups:\r\n\r\n    Principles of the Fundamental Framework\r\n    Principles underlying habits and habit change\r\n    Principles of growth, development, and maintenance\r\n    Principles of Individuality and Interdependence\r\n    Principles of Cooperation and Interdependence\r\n    Principles related to each of the 7 Habits\r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the principles in each group:\r\n\r\n***Principles of the Fundamental Framework***\r\n\r\nWe begin with the principle of cause and effect. There are many ways of stating this one law:\r\n\r\n    The law of karma: intentional actions (and clumsy or foolish errors) have consequences.\r\n    Biblical: As you sow, so shall you reap.\r\n    Jesus: By their fruits will they be known.\r\n    Gandhi: The ends and the means are one.\r\n\r\nBeing aware of life in relation to this law, we see that we can observe actions and results, and learn what actions will, and will not, achieve our intended results. This then helps us understand three other laws:\r\n\r\n*The Law of Love*\r\n\r\nHarmless love produces harmless, loving result. The intent to heal directs us towards healing. The intent of living a healthy life directs us towards a healthy life.\r\n\r\n*The Law of Truth*\r\n\r\nTruth is composed of honesty and integrity:\r\n\r\n    Honesty is when our words match reality. It requires seeing reality as it is, that is, not being deluded. It also requires being able to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t see any way of telling you this now.\u201d\r\n    Integrity is when our actions match our words. We do what we say we will do.\r\n\r\nTruthfulness opens us to a deeper level called Wisdom.\r\n\r\n*The truth that we are not separate*\r\n\r\nIt does not work to wish good for ourselves, and harm to others, or good to others and not to ourselves. Love, in intent and action, acts on the actor, no matter who the intended recipient is. Barriers to love, including unwillingness to give love, unwillingness to receive love, and harmful intent, affect the person within whom these qualities reside, no matter the intended target.\r\n\r\n*The truth that we are not identical*\r\n\r\nLove is the basis of the idea that we are not separate. At the same time, respect requires that we not pretend to be identical to, or encompass the other. This creates the paradox of non-duality. We must respect both unity of spirit and the individual identity of each creative soul, each person incarnating his or her own unique qualities and destiny.\r\n\r\n***Principles underlying habits and habit change***\r\n\r\nWe can understand habits and habit change as an extension of \u201cas you sow, so shall you reap\u201d through repetition over time.\r\n\r\n\u201cSow an action, reap a habit. Sow a habit, reap a character. Sow a character, reap a destiny.\u201d This is true for both healthy and unhealthy habits. So, to change from one to the other, we must stop sowing unhealthy actions and start, and continue to, sow healthy actions.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything is created twice, first in the mind.\u201d This has two consequences:\r\n\r\n    Nothing ever popped into being. Things come into being in the physical, emotional, and social worlds first in the thoughts and motivations of one person, then later in reality.\r\n    If we think a thought or feel a desire, even it we do not act on it, this leaves karmic traces, including unfulfilled desires. So each harmful thought or hurtful feeling will play out unless and until we bring it into awareness and heal it.\r\n\r\nWith these basic principles in place, we are ready to look at how to grow a healthy life.\r\n\r\n***Principles of growth, development, and maintenance***\r\n\r\nAlthough mental creation is nearly instantaneous, creating actual results (such as habits or achieved goals) in the emotional, physical, material, and social realms takes time and cultivation.\r\n\r\nCultivation includes planting seeds more than once, watering, fertilizing, and weeding. It also includes not pulling up plants by the roots to see if they are growing yet. Cultivation requires patience, persistence, observation, and loving action guided by caring intelligence.\r\n\r\n***Principles of Individuality and Interdependence***\r\n\r\nFunctionally, each person has freedom of choice. It is interesting to note that Covey\u2019s work in this area follows the work of Viktor Frankl, who survived the concentration camps of the Nazi Holocaust and went on to form Logotherapy, which teaches the importance of meaning in life.\r\n\r\nWe each see life in our own way. Each of us has our own framework, what Covey calls a paradigm. It contains our assumptions about life, ourselves, and the world. It is partially unconscious, and if affects our perceptions. We interpret our world through our paradigm, and thus, we often see and hear what we expect to see and hear. For example, if we criticize ourselves, then we believe that that others criticize us. However much we are, or are not, free to create our own lives, we create the meaning we perceive in each and every event of our lives.\r\n\r\nEach of us has freedom of choice. We can become aware of our paradigm, of our actions at all levels: thoughts, feelings, words, and deeds. Once we are aware of them, we can develop our ability to take control of of each of these, stop old habits, create new ones, build and transform our character, and change our destiny.\r\n\r\nThere is one very difficult aspect of freedom of choice. It means that, even when we believe that our problems are caused by life, other people, or bad luck, in actuality, we are the central player in creating our own life and experience. This is what Stephen Covey calls \u201cthe bitter pill.\u201d We must take responsibility for our lives - including all the painful aspects - before we can begin to make deep healthy changes.\r\n\r\nWe begin those healthy changes by developing Habits 1, 2, and 3 below. See those sections for the relevant principles.\r\n\r\n***Principles of Cooperation and Interdependence***\r\n\r\nTwo independent people or more choosing to work together towards common goals can do much more than any one of us alone. There are two principles behind this.\r\n\r\nInterdependence requires independence. To be independent is a crucial step on the path to being effective. If two people try to work together when either one or both are not independent, then the relationship will be off-balance. The one who is not independent may not be able to show up on time and do the work. No one has to be perfect, but people have much more to contribute to genuine, beneficial, cooperative efforts when each of us is independent. When one person is persistently not independent, then this creates an out of balance relationship called codependence, which is ineffective and unhealthy for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Two people working together can accomplish much more than they can working separately. The song Lean on Me explores the many ways that this is true. And the potential is exponential: Two people in cooperation can, at times, achieve what 50 people might do, working alone.\r\n\r\n***Principles related to each of the 7 Habits***\r\n\r\n*Habit 1: Proactivity*\r\n\r\nIncreasing our awareness and our freedom to choose aligns us with the principle that each of us has that freedom. People who blame others are living under the weight of an untruth. It is our job to change our situation, create the opportunity, then live proactively and responsively in the opportunity we are proactively creating.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the single most proactive thing that anyone can do is increase his or her own proactivity. How do we do this: by practicing habits of awareness, healthy conscience, imagination, and independent will.\r\n\r\n*Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind*\r\n\r\nWe can achieve our goals. As awareness is beneficial, it is easier to achieve our goals if we are aware of what we truly want.\r\n\r\nPeople are not necessarily unitary, and have apparently conflicting desires. If we can unify the functions of our mind, we achieve inner synergy. Thus, through vision, we \u201clead from the right,\u201d and allow our lives to be guided by our inner intuition and sense of rightness. Then we \u201cmanage from the left,\u201d rationally laying out a schedule of activities that will shape our character and achieve our goals. Covey is using the terms right and left to refer to two different human capacities: Creative experiential living and rational, committed planning and action.\r\n\r\n*Habit 3: Put First Things First*\r\n\r\nSeveral principles come into play in Habit 3, where we turn our long-term goals into a weekly schedule, week after week:\r\n\r\n    The first principle is that the priorities in our mind create the priorities in our lives.\r\n    The second is that work fills time allotted.\r\n    The third is that success comes through first planning, and then carrying out the plan.\r\n    The fourth is that unexpected things happen.\r\n\r\nThe first step of the solution is to set weekly goal towards our long-term goals. Then we make a schedule where we put what matters most first in our minds and, as much as we can, first each day. Then we live that schedule, and rearrange as needed when unexpected things happen. Doing this for 52 weeks, we achieve our goals for the year. Doing this year after year, we create our destiny.\r\n\r\n*Habit 4: Seek win-win; win-win or no deal*\r\n\r\nThe underlying principle is that only what is beneficial for everyone involved is beneficial for each one of us. There is no real case of \u201cI win; you lose.\u201d Even in competitive sports, the real benefits come from participating more than from winning, so, when competitive sports are done in a healthy way, everyone wins.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this is challenging because each of us carries a very deep paradigm of competitiveness. Some feel they must win; others that they must lose. Others simply find that the win/lose trap of society is unbearable. To achieve Habit 4, we take deep responsibility for our own individual adaptation of the competitive mentality of our society, and we seek something better. We seek relationships where everyone benefits. We even come to a place where we engage only in such relationships. That\u2019s called win-win or no deal.\r\n\r\n*Habit 5: Seek first to understand*\r\n\r\nPrinciples behind habit 5 include:\r\n\r\n    Humility. Let us not rush ahead thinking we understand when, in all likelihood, we do not understand deeply enough.\r\n    Easing of anxiety and fear. Everyone lives with some anxiety and fear, often a lot of it. The principle here is that people listen better when we feel safe, and we feel safe when we know we are heard.\r\n    Speak within another person\u2019s language and way of thinking, so they can work with what they hear.\r\n\r\nPutting these together, we listen first. We understand first. We ensure the other person feels safe and feels understood. Then we ask permission to share our view. Once we do this, we have their attention, and genuine communication is possible.\r\n\r\n*Habit 6: Synergy*\r\n\r\nThis habit is very hard to write about. The underlying spiritual principle is harmony. Harmony: when each person is in harmony with himself or herself, and true to himself or herself, and we share common goals and are responsive to one another, unexpected and wonderful results arise.\r\n\r\n*Habit 7: Self-care and self-improvement*\r\n\r\nAll people, all living systems, are constantly changing. We need renewal. Healthy habits create a healthy body and mind. We are creative and self-creative. If we are not being creative, we get sick, or get tangled in unhealthy habits of time-wasting and even addiction. Thus it is necessary to develop and maintain healthy habits of body, emotions, mind, energy, Creative Soul, and Spirit.\r\n\r\nThis also challenges our notions of entitlement. We are not entitled to success, or even health, or even survival. We are entitled only the opportunity to make our lives work, to embody and manifest our unique essence as creative souls and our common spiritual essence as living beings and human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Link](https://www.quora.com/What-Principles-was-Stephen-Covey-speaking-of)", "learning_data": 11300, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 3087, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Why do I want to learn stuff?", "content": "* what's the goal with random stuff like map projections?\r\n* Keeping myself intellectually active?\r\n* Is it useful to learn stuff like that when you don't enjoy the learning?\r\n* Is learning random stuff detrimental to focus?", "learning_data": 11301, "reference": [1874, 3239, 2151]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 3088, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "idea: learn to paint", "content": "", "learning_data": null, "reference": [3089, 81, 2207]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 3089, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "projects with Filippa", "content": "", "learning_data": null, "reference": [3327, 3090, 3088, 2704]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 3090, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "idea: learn to sew", "content": "", "learning_data": null, "reference": [3089]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 3091, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "book: The 4-Hour Workweek", "content": "The book has a lot of (from my perspective now) largely unconnected collected quotes, which apply to the following topics:\r\n\r\n## Just achieving shit without questioning too much\r\n\r\n* As student, just risk it all, because all is nothing\r\n* Running in the opposite direction\r\n* Shorter deadlines means better focus, means equal or better result.\r\n* So be bold and don't worry what people think.

Teams do not measure the impact of their work. Or, if measurement happens, it is done in isolation by the product management team and selectively shared. You have no idea if your work worked.\r\n2. **Rapid shuffling of teams** and projects (aka Team Tetris). Instead of compelling missions or initiatives, teams deal in feature and project assignments. Chronic multitasking and over-utilization.\r\n3. **Success theater** around \u201cshipping\u201d with little discussion about impact. You can tell a great deal about an organization by what it celebrates.\r\n4. **Infrequent (acknowledged) failures** and scrapped work. No removed features. Primary measure of success is delivered features, not delivered outcomes. Work is rarely discarded in light of data and learning. Often the team lacks the prerequisite safety to admit misfires.\r\n5. **No connection to core metrics**. Infrequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team cannot connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Impossible to connect iterations to \u201cwhat matters most\u201d.\r\n6. **No PM retrospectives**. Product managers do not conduct regular retrospectives on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits. Developers have \u201cpassing tests\u201d, but product managers do not. Product managers view velocity and output as their key performance indicator.\r\n7. **Obsessing about prioritization**. Mismatch between prioritization rigor (deciding what gets worked on) and validation rigor (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on). Prioritization rigor is designed exclusively to temper internal agendas so that people \u201cfeel confident\u201d. Lots of work goes into determining which ideas to work on, leaving little leeway for adjustments and improvisation based on data. Roadmaps show a list of features, not areas of focus and/or outcomes.\r\n8. **No tweaking**. Once work is \u201cdone\u201d, the team moves immediately on to the next \u201cproject\u201d, leaving no time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data\r\n9. **Culture of hand-offs**. Front-loaded process in place to \u201cget ahead of the work\u201d so that items are \u201cready for engineering\u201d. Team is not directly involved in research, problem exploration, or experimentation and validation. Once work is shipped, team has little contact with support, customer success, and sales.\r\n10. **Large batches**. Without the mandate to experiment, features are delivered in single large batches instead of delivering incrementally. You might still work in sprints (yay, we\u2019re \u201cAgile\u201d), but nothing new is reaching customers at the conclusion of each sprint.\r\n11. **Chasing upfront revenue**. Features are implemented to close new deals. While not inherently wrong, the economic justifications are often flimsy (at best), and fail to account for the non-linear increase in product complexity (you make the quarter, but you pay for it many times over later). Again, this reinforces the idea that features are the unit of value measurement. Product decisions lack a sound economic grounding.\r\n12. **Shiny objects**. Low visibility for refactoring work and debt work-down. Low visibility for overall value delivery capabilities. As mentioned, primary measure of success is new feature output. Little appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects. Little awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* *todo* make own notes\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: How To Take Smart Notes\r\n\r\n`started`\r\n\r\n[How To Take Smart Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/)\r\n\r\n> But recently I picked up How To Take Smart Notes (affiliate link) by S\u00f6nke Ahrens.

Stop treating it like one. It's a physical thing that happens to your body. It's your body saying \"something is wrong, fix it.\" Symptoms of stress/anxiety include things that can be measured by doctors, such as weight gain, lack of sleep, blood pressure issues, acne, hair loss, etc. Many people try to treat stress as a feeling, and do things to make them feel better, like yoga, workout, have sex, go to the gun range, or buy little stress balls that they squeeze when they feel stressed. This is the incorrect way to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nThink of stress as financial stress. What is financial stress? You have too much to pay for and not enough money. If you were financially stressed and I told you I could make you feel better about it by selling you a squeeze ball for 20 bucks, would you fall for that garbage? I hope not.\r\n\r\nThis is how stress stacks up on your life: Imagine a graph. There is an invisible line somewhere on it going straight, horizontally, all the way across. That is your personal \"stress threshold\". Literally everything that you have to do in your life is a stressor. Imagine them as blocks stacking up on top of each other. Some are bigger than others. The closer you get to your threshold, the more stressed you feel. If you do not prevent them from crossing that threshold, you will enter depression, which is your body saying \"screw it, you won't fix it, I'll just shut everything down until it works itself out.\", much like how if you're freezing to death in the woods your body starts shutting down to save the vital organs, but you will still eventually freeze to death anyways. Think of stress as you shivering when it's cold, and depression as your body shutting down to preserve vital organs.\r\n\r\nSo, this is THE way to manage stress: You manage it. The pilot giving the training said to make a list, either mentally or literally, of EVERYTHING that stresses you out. Next, look at the list and see what you can actually take care of right then and there, and start knocking things off the list. You will literally be removing stress from your life. You ever wonder why people say they feel like their \"load is lighter\" or \"weight has been lifted off their shoulders\" after they complete a task? Because it has. Ever wonder why people say they feel good after mowing the lawn, or going to the gym, or whatever? It's because they've actually removed a stress block from their life. They've done something. Often times, people try to manage stress by drinking tea, or doing yoga, or doing things that simulate to their mind that they're accomplishing something, when really they're just tricking their brain into releasing the chemical that it does when you actually get something done. The REAL way is to actually identify the things that stress you out, and REMOVE them from your pile of stressors.\r\n\r\nWhen you make your list, literally write out everything. Pretty much if you think about something and say \"Oh crap, I have to do that.\", it's a stressor. Everything from brushing your teeth in the morning, to changing that light bulb in the laundry room, to gassing up your car, to studying for that test, to out-processing for that deployment, to going to that job interview, etc etc. Write them down, look at it, and think \"Oh shoot, I could just change that lightbulb right now. I could mow the lawn. I could fix that door hinge.\" Do this and you will be on your way to becoming more productive and less stressed. I've been doing this for years now and it works GREAT. It's how these fighter pilots manage their personal lives and flying a stupid fast war machine in combat. There have been a few times where I did still get too stressed out, but it was because I literally just had too much on my plate that was beyond my control, but since I understood how stress works, I was able to still get ahold of it and break myself out of the slight depression I had slipped into.\r\n\r\nFURTHER NOTES:\r\n\r\nTypes of stress:\r\n\r\n-Residual Stress (AKA Emotional Baggage): This type of stress cannot be eliminated, or is VERY difficult to remove. It is things that have happened to you in the past that you drag with you forever. They feel like things you need to \"fix\", but since they're locked in the past, you can't do anything about them, so they cause your stress pile to start out a little higher no matter what you do. You fell on your face that one time at school, or your parents never loved you, or you got stage fright that one time, etc etc. Some people have more than others, and it just always eats at the back of your mind. I have found an awesome way to get over this, but it is using my interpretation of the \"heathen worldview\", which is another tip for another time.\r\n\r\n-Reoccurring Stress: These are things that pop up on a reoccurring basis, such as daily chores, bills, house or work maintenance, etc. They are usually small stressors for people, but since they pop up often, they're always needing to be removed anyways. People often shrug these off, but they can sneak up on you. If you don't take care of the small things, the big things will stack higher, faster. Ever heard the phrase \"the straw that broke the camel's back\"? That straw was probably a Reoccurring Stressor.\r\n\r\n-Time Sensitive Stress: These are stressors that are hanging over your head but cannot be taken care of yet. Your college finals. Job interviews. Upcoming vacation. Etc. They are among the hardest for me to deal with, because they are there, but you can't do them yet. The way to reduce their impact is to ensure you are knocking out the easier stress blocks in the meantime. Change that lightbulb, get your car serviced, mail that package, etc. Another way is to recognize the precursors to that Time Sensitive Stressor, like studying for the college finals, or preparing for the job interview. You will still be knocking things out, being productive, removing stress, and will be better prepared for the TSS when it does arrive.\r\n\r\nA note on Depression:\r\n\r\nThis part of the training has to basically alienate a specific group of people. If you are clinically depressed, then this method may not help you manage your depression because your brain works differently. Depression is where you haven't removed enough stress blocks and so your body says \"screw it\". The danger here is that it will remove your energy, motiviation, etc. By understanding this, you will be able to get back in the saddle, remove some stressors, and get your life back under control. The pilot/instructor went deeply into the phases of depression, and what is known as a \"psychotic break\". Depending on where you are in your depression when you hit your psychotic break, you will lash out in a certain way. Example: if you're in \"inner\", you will hurt/kill yourself. If you're in \"outer\", you will hurt/kill someone else. But what makes it a \"psychotic break\" is that is will be completely bizarre. The example he used was Brittney Spears shaving her head vs. the NASA officer who went to Florida to kidnap her boyfriend's lover. Brittney Spears had much less stress on her life, yet she flew through all the stages of depression and basically hit her psychotic break at a point that caused her to just completely snap and shave her head. The NASA officer underwent a TREMENDOUSLY stressful entire life before finally lashing out at a person who made little to no impact on her overall life. It basically demonstrated how much some people can mentally endure compared to others, and how failure to manage it can cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nA story of my usage of this training:\r\n\r\nI'll make it quick. I was a SSGt in USAF. I was in college full time also. I had orders to the desert. I was a crew lead at my base for my specific job. I had finals for college coming up. In that same week, I had WAPS testing, which is how USAF enlisted troops test for rank. It's a big deal. I ALSO had to out-process for my deployment that week (anyone in can attest to what a stupid pain in the ass that can be). I was super stressed and it got to be too much. But I understood how stress worked. I couldn't make my finals come sooner, nor my WAPS test. Out-processing could be done during work hours. But I still had to lead my crew, which entailed all kinds of bullcrap. So here's what I did. First thing first, I told another NCO on my crew \"Listen man, you're an NCO, you know the ropes, you're the crew lead now.\" I literally just dumped part of my plate onto his, but he was trained/qualified/capable of doing it, and that's literally what he was there for was to lead the crew if I wasn't around. So I just made him the primary and I took the alternate slot. A huge stressor gone. Next, I ensured all my little stuff was taken care of, such as chores/ honey-do's around the house. After that, I made sure I had a dedicated time for WAPS and college studying, so that that stressor didn't bleed into my thoughts all the time. Finally, I made out-processing my primary concern during the work day, so no work-related stressors could pile up. All I had to do was make appointments and knock things off a checklist. This literally saved me from becoming overwhelmed and let me make it through the ordeal. When it was all said and done I did great on my college finals, I didn't make rank (that's OK though, the cutoff score was high for my career that year), and I got to the desert (and back) in one piece. Thanks random fighter pilot on instructor TDY!\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope this helps someone. It has gotten me through a lot, and I share it whenever I can. Take care everyone!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't think of stress as a feeling. Treat it like financial stress. Think of stress as physical blocks stacking up on your life. They key to keeping stress levels down is to REMOVE the blocks. Make a list of stress blocks, and ELIMINATE THEM. It will not just make you FEEL better, it will make you better.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: What is the best dumb TV?\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24666968>\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nDon't think I will ever need a TV, not sure why I saved this though\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Blender Stuff\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n* [Topography]({{< ref \"topography\" >}})\r\n\r\n## Linklist\r\n\r\n### 3D Scan\r\n\r\n* [Scanning reflective objects](https://www.3dscanstore.com/blog/3d-scanning-reflective-objects)\r\n* [Photogrammetry - Taking photos](https://www.tested.com/art/makers/460142-art-photogrammetry-how-take-your-photos/)\r\n* [CCTag marker detection](https://github.com/alicevision/CCTag)\r\n* [Microscope vs. Focus Stacking](https://old.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/9w944b/see_the_difference_between_microscope_and_focus/)\r\n* [Photoscanning a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/9xy7lr/i_photoscanned_a_person_results_are_actually/)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* [Mill Blackbird](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4pi16j/how_automobile_commercials_will_be_made_from_now/)\r\n* [Micropolygon Displacement](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/8ylhx7/micropolygon_displacement/)\r\n* [Why CGI sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition - Wikipedia\r\n\r\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition>\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* I should really do something with Barrow's Boys.

Do-goals determine the plans and actions to be performed for an activity. The lowest level of this hierarchy is the motor-goal, which specifies just how the actions are performed:\r\n\r\n> Design for individuals and the results may be wonderful for the particular people they were designed for, but a mismatch for others.

I will explain how you might visualize a Quaternion as well as explain the different operations that can be applied to quaternions. I will also compare applications of matrices, euler angles, and quaternions and try to explain when you would want to use quaternions instead of Euler angles or matrices and when you would not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Dijkstra in Disguise\r\n\r\n[Dijkstra in Disguise](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17745779)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Book-writing Vim Workflow\r\n\r\n<https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/vim-is-saving-me-hours-of-work-when-writing-books-and-courses>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Windows 10 Bug from 1974\r\n\r\n<https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1058676834940776450.html>\r\n\r\n* A 50 year old bug in current Windows\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Hacks that don't scale\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18400020>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: How to write umaintainable code\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Typography in WALL\u00b7E\r\n\r\n<https://typesetinthefuture.com/2018/12/04/walle/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: New Programming Jargon\r\n\r\n<https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Web Obesity\r\n\r\n<https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Atomic Habits\r\n\r\nJames Clear\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Bad Science - Ben Goldrace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Prisoners of Geography\r\n\r\nby Tim Marshall\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Greens: why we eat the leaves that we do\r\n\r\nThe Botanist in the Kitchen\r\n\r\n<https://botanistinthekitchen.blog/2013/04/08/greens-why-we-eat-the-leaves-that-we-do/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: How to solve any problem?\r\n\r\n<https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: ARCHITECTURE.md\r\n\r\n<https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Spinach sending emails\r\n\r\n<https://www.euronews.com/living/2021/02/01/scientists-have-taught-spinach-to-send-emails-and-it-could-warn-us-about-climate-change>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: The Power of Personal Science: Inside the Mind of a Mad Scientist\r\n\r\n<https://jamesclear.com/barry-marshall>\r\n\r\n> For decades the world's greatest doctors and researchers had believed that stomach ulcers and, eventually, stomach cancers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid in the stomach.\r\n\r\n> Barry Marshall wasn't buying it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Proportion Harmony\r\n\r\nFibonacci, but it does not suck\r\n\r\n<https://old.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/l8tur9/i_put_together_a_lesson_in_proportion_harmony_its/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: The unreasonable effectiveness of simple HTML | Hacker News\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25915313>\r\n\r\n## notes\r\n\r\narticle, but very short, could probably a snippet\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Getting better at Linux with mini projects\r\n\r\n<https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Shogun - James Clavell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Brokerages with free API trading\r\n\r\n<https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/lhdjks/are_there_any_brokerages_with_free_trading_api/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: So, You Want to Learn to Break Ciphers\r\n\r\n<https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2015/09/28/so-you-want-to-learn-to-break-ciphers/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Toyota Throttle stuck to floormat\r\n\r\n<https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/business/toyota-agrees-to-settlement-in-fatal-acceleration-crash.html#:~:text=Toyota%20agreed%20on%20Friday%20to,trials%20over%20the%20acceleration%20issue>\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nWhen does engineering stops and UX starts?\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: \u201cUser Engagement\u201d Is Code for \u201cAddiction\u201d\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26153331>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Ditherpunk 2 \u2014 beyond 1-bit\r\n\r\n<https://www.makeworld.gq/2021/02/dithering.html>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Before buying a NYT subscription, here's what it'll take to cancel it\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26174269>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: An experiment in giving cash to recently homeless people\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26116833>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Citibank just got a $500M lesson in the importance of UI design\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26180785>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: 99percentinvisible\r\n\r\n<https://99percentinvisible.org/>\r\n\r\nI want to get new ones (maybe), but I also want to read the ones that are already there, as long as they are interesting\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: All Google Search Operations\r\n\r\n<https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace\r\n\r\nno bullshit advice on how to write well\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Jesse James Garett - The Elements of User Expirience\r\n\r\n> Perhaps this book is already a little outdated, but this is exactly the book that at the very beginning helped me understand what the design process consists of and how it all works.

Using an international database on adolescent achievement in science, mathematics, and reading (N = 472,242), we showed that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in two of every three countries, and in nearly all countries, more girls appeared capable of college-level STEM study than had enrolled. Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality.\r\n\r\n> Our analysis suggests that the percentage of girls who would likely be successful and enjoy further STEM study was considerably  higher  than  the  percentage  of  women  graduating in STEM fields, implying that there is a loss of female STEM capacity between secondary and tertiary education.\r\n\r\n> Thus, even when girls\u2019 absolute science scores were higher than those of boys, as in Finland, boys were often better in science relative to their overall  academic  average. \r\n\r\n> We also found that boys often expressed higher self-efficacy, more joy in science, and a broader interest in science  than  did  girls.  These  differences  were  also  larger in more gender-equal countries and were related to the students\u2019 personal academic strength.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nown notes!\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Feeling Good\r\n\r\nDavid Burns\r\n\r\nThe book about CBT.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Der Schimmelreiter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Anna Book Recommendations\r\n\r\n(actually from her brother)\r\n\r\n* M\u00e1rquez - Hundert Jahre Einsamkeit\r\n* Hesse - Narzi\u00df und Goldmund\r\n* Salinger - The Cather in the Rye\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Kazuo Ishiguro\r\n* Julian Barnes (besonders \"Vom Ende einer Geschichte\", audible)\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Thinking in Bits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Disability Friendly Webdesign / Accessibility\r\n\r\n<https://webaim.org/intro/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Moral Crumple Zones\r\n\r\n<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2757236>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Internet Census 2012\r\n\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20140909143106/http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html>\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Using Anki to Remember Everything\r\n\r\n* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22492381>\r\n* Article is about personal memorization style from some Shopify dude\r\n* `I just...can\u2019t relate to living this way.

For beginners out there wondering what other YouTube channels might be valuable, here are a few I follow. Most them are 2d, but a lot have 3d tutorials as well. Posting from my phone, so it might need some edits!\r\n\r\nGamesPlusJames - One of my faves. Amazing tutorial series, good udemy content. His 2d Snow Bros YouTube Series was what brought me out of tutorial hell and helped me build the foundational skills for 2d games. Its the YouTube series I recommend for any friends looking to get into 2d Unity.\r\n\r\nAlex Zotov - Straightforward short focused tutorials, mostly for beginners.\r\n\r\nCode Monkey - mix of intermediate topics - has some tutorial series.\r\n\r\nBlackthornprod - Focus on art, design, and code. He's got some gold tutorials. His turned based tactics game Udemy course is also solid.\r\n\r\nCouch Ferret - Amazing 2d tutorial series, with focus on movement, aiming, etc. Very clear explanations.\r\n\r\nFirst Gear Games - focused on unity online multiplayer. Great deep dives. Beginner friendly. Also looks at other topics. Underrated channel.\r\n\r\nLost Relic Games - Mix of 2d fundamentals and broad unity discussion\r\n\r\nTurbo Makes Games - 2d, 3D, DOTS, and provides clear explanations.\r\n\r\nTom Weiland - Amazing Multiplayer Tutorial series as he navigates building his own multiplayer game. There's not a lot of multiplayer development channels, so I'm stoked when I find ones with good content.\r\n\r\nxzippyzachx - Branching off of Tom's tutorial series, and working on his own multiplayer.\r\n\r\nQuill18 Creates - Tutorial series, multiplayer, intermediate topics, and he does a lot of game jams and breakdowns\r\n\r\nUnity3dCollege - want to go from beginner to intermediate/advanced? Check out Jason's channel. Focused on strong coding conventions and patterns, it really can help level up your skills.\r\n\r\nSebastian Legue - seems quite popular. I've followed some of his tutorials to solve a few issues complex topics.\r\n\r\nInfallible Code - focused on more advanced topics, and good coding practices. Also some solid podcast episodes talking about coding and unity in general.\r\n\r\nBinary Lunar - Animation, Shaders, Movement, and other topics\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n[Edit] /u/MikePounce - Recommended Channels:\r\n\r\nJonas Tyroller - General tips about making your game and making it fun & appealing\r\n\r\nThe Game Dev Guru - Optimization and advanced techniques, the real treasure is his website https://thegamedev.guru/\r\n\r\nGame Dev Guide - Very nice tutorials, in-depth explanation of techniques you see in AAA games, highly recommended as a successor to Brackey\r\n\r\n---\r\n#list: Ask HN - How to learn sales?\r\n\r\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24601579>\r\n\r\n## notes\r\n\r\n* own words!\r\n\r\n## take 1\r\n\r\n> You need to separate sales from marketing. Sales is a conversation, marketing is a broadcast. Marketing gets the phone to ring, sales takes the call and closes the deal.\r\n\r\n> For B2B sales resembles project management: the goal is not to convince everyone to buy your product or service but to diagnose their needs and only engage with firms that will benefit.\r\n\r\n> For larger deals you \"sell with your ears\" as much as you talk.\r\n\r\n> I find Neil Rackham's \"Spin Selling\" very useful. Peter Cohan's \"Great Demo\" embeds a lot of discovery advice and suggests that a good demo is really a conversation driven by mutual curiosity about customer needs and software capabilities.\r\n\r\n> For B2B customer development interviews (those early market discovery conversations) I have a short book you may find helpful. See [Link](https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2020/01/30/40-tips-for-b2b-customer-development-interviews/) (there is also a link at the bottom for a PDF version).\r\n\r\n> Two final books I would suggest, while not exactly sales books, are \"The Innovator's DNA\" by Clayton Christensen and \"The Right It (Pretotype It)\" by Alberto Savoia. They cover a number of techniques for finding the right problem to solve and determining if your solution is a good fit for customer needs. I mention them because it's not uncommon for a startup to have a product problem that manifests as a sales problem.\r\n\r\n## take 2\r\n\r\n> First time founder here who came from sales at a big consulting firm, and then and then had to develop the whole marketing and sales stack for our startup.\r\n\r\n> Most of the books recommended in this thread assume that you're working for a established firm, with product / market fit, etc.\r\n\r\n> Clearly that's not the case for a start-up.\r\n\r\n> Read up on what Pete Kanzanjy publishes https://www.foundingsales.com/ - it covers the the \"founder-led sales\" phase.", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 4067, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "movie: Hardcore Henry", "content": "", "learning_data": null, "reference": []}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 4073, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Panacea", "content": "Remedy for all weaknesses/deseases", "learning_data": 11668, "reference": [3599]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 4093, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Fun & Memes", "content": "", "learning_data": 11672, "reference": [2393]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 4098, "fields": {"profile": 4, "title": "Biological and Machine Intelligence (BaMI)", "content": "[Book](https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/biological-and-machine-intelligence/BaMI-Complete.pdf)\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\n**Theory of Thousand Brains** describes theory of human neocortex: Does not learn only one model of object/concept, instead it builds many models, using different input (sensors/motors) -> Models vote to reach a consensus on what is sensed\r\n\r\n**HTM**: algorithmic components of that theory, only including biological details relevant for information\r\n\r\n\r\n# HTM Overview\r\n\r\nGoal: create intelligence based on principles of human intelligence; not re-create the human brain\r\n\r\n**Neocortex**\r\n\r\n* last evolutionary step\r\n* intelligent due to its size; got so large by duplicating basic element\r\n* hierarchical structure (passing information from region to region via white matter)\r\n* connection to input defines, what region it becomes, not structure\r\n\r\nSparsely distributed activity of neurons -> input as well (semantic meaning maintained)\r\n\r\nTherefore: possible to activate multiple representations without confusion\r\n\r\nNeocortex interacts with and controls older brain areas; obtains inputs as sensory data and motor commands -> encoded as SDR; as well possible for data with no biological equivalent (e.g. GPS)", "learning_data": 11673, "reference": [3316]}}, {"model": "main.note", "pk": 4107, "fields": {"profile": 4, "title": "Docker auf Remote Rechner", "content": "* Du meldest dich per SSH auf dem Rechner cheo an\r\n\r\n* Zur Installation des Rootless Docker Daemons gibst du folgenden Befehl ein:\r\n\r\n```$ dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install```\r\n\r\nDas musst du nur einmal vor dem ersten Start machen.\r\n\r\n* Du startest den Docker Daemon mit\r\n```$ systemctl --user start docker```\r\n\r\nDas musst du eventuell jedes Mal machen, wenn du dich neu auf dem Rechner einloggst und der Rechner zwischendurch neu gestartet wurde.
