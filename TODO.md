## MUST

* start testing
* implement debug framework
* implement messages framework
* find a way to keep the q card constant (in case we want to edit and go back)
* rename the card types in Tuple of Card Edit form
* allow basic connections

## SHOULD

* more elaborate algo for what to queue/how much is due
* implement the "write down your excuse for not doing this"
* adapt Edit card / new Card
* show that connection worked
* handle long blockquotes
* check whether quotes work at all
* allow Search
* display the excuses (don't call it `skip card`)
* implement connect feature
* allow bug reporting in UI
* handle projects correctly
* display card list, allow filtering and sorting
* find out how env variables for pg variables are done properly, apparently `DATABASE_NAME` and stuff is bound to switch, yet I need it locally

## COULD

* finish the github style statistics feature
* research better SR
* import all supabase data
* all the auth stuff
* landing page/onboarding
* allow filtering the queue to only fun stuff
* make a bash alias for the really long Python requirements thing

## IDEAS

* set how many card you want to each day? Or time? Or code the queue in such a way that it's finishable?

## BUGS

* type of card does not seem to be preselected in dropdown?
